<div class="para-image">
This is just a simple post file to see how things work.
<figure class="fig-left" >
<img src="/assets/20170410_111022-1600x900.jpg">
<figcaption>This is the caption for the image</figcaption>
</figure>
AFTER image in the source - This is some more text just to provide a bit of context to the image.
The idea being that the text will wrap in the left half of the page
and the image will appear in the right half
</div>

This is after the preceding paragraph..
